Visualizing Business Density: Where is NYC Buzzing?
We created a heatmap to visualize the density of 24/7 businesses across NYC. This heatmap highlights areas with the highest concentration of businesses that are open 24/7, revealing economic activity hotspots. Darker areas on the map represent lower business density, while hotspots of activity appear in bright yellow, indicating economic vibrancy.
From Lower Manhattan to North Brooklyn, these clusters reflect the heart of NYC's late-night scene - offering everything from convenience to quality, no matter the hour.
